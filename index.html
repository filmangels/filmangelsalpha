                                <p>Wall Street investment banker–turned–entrepreneur Thomas Trenker founded Film Angels in his twenties after helping found or fund multiple startups. Sand Hill Road venture capitalist Saad Khan of Guy Kawasaki's Garage Technology Ventures served as his cofounder. <details><summary>(</summary>The founding team also comprises a diverse group of influential Silicon Valley professionals from a variety of backgrounds such as early-stage investing, corporate law, real estate, software development, and internet startups.</details>) Film Angels has since grown into a go-to resource for Hollywood A-listers, Oscar winners and nominees, industry greats, and rising stars looking to fund their independent films or personal projects outside the studio system. <details><summary>(</summary>Creative control counts as a precious commodity in high demand among the world's top filmmakers.</details>) Statistically, $5-10 million budgets represent the sweet spot of successful film finance. They allow for first-rate, Academy Award–winning production values without precluding superior risk-adjusted ROIs. Win-wins become not only possible but increasingly likely.</p>

Film Angels regularly features such luminaries as Apple founder Steve Wozniak, AOL CEO Barry Schuler, Movielink CEO Jim Ramo, San Francisco Film Commission Executive Director Stefanie Coyote, '90s pop sensation Lance Bass, California Film Commissioner Hilary Armstrong, and many more. Internet giant Google even made its headquarters available exclusively to Film Angels for an unprecedented pitch extravaganza headlined by legendary rock icon Carlos Santana and billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper.</p>
