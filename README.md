# Film Angels 

## World's premier angel group for film 

Film Angels is the world's first and foremost professional angel investor organization dedicated to funding independent film projects and film-related startup companies. We routinely connect the most promising new movie ventures with the most suitable individual investors, aka angels. 

Inspired by, modeled after, complementary to, and allied with leading angel networks (e.g., Band of Angels, Keiretsu Forum), Film Angels formally launched in 2005 at the Silicon Valley Capital Club in downtown San Jose and has been discreetly active in Silicon Valley and beyond for nearly twenty years. Members of our local chapters in San Francisco, Palo Alto–Mountain View–San Jose, Los Angeles, New York City, and London have invested in dozens of productions. 

## Funding film the Silicon Valley way 

Wall Street investment banker–turned–entrepreneur Thomas Trenker, a first-generation immigrant from Austria by way of Switzerland, founded Film Angels in his twenties after helping found or fund multiple startups. Sand Hill Road venture capitalist Saad Khan of former Apple chief evangelist Guy Kawasaki's Garage Technology Ventures joined as his cofounder after hearing him speak at Stanford business school's Future of Entertainment conference, where Thomas challenged top studio executives to rationally rethink and radically redo film finance. The founding team also boasts an eclectic group of influential Silicon Valley professionals from diverse backgrounds, such as early-stage investing, real estate, corporate law, the humanities, software development, and internet startups. We were fortunate to count among them the late Dr. Frank S. Greene Jr., a true pioneer as a semiconductor engineer (inducted into the prestigious Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame in 2001), supercomputing entrepreneur, and venture capitalist. 

Film Angels has since grown into a go-to resource for A-listers, Oscar winners and nominees, Hollywood royalty, industry greats, and rising stars looking to fund their independent films or personal projects outside the confines of the studio system. Typically, they pursue creative freedom and creative control, a precious commodity in high demand among the world's top filmmakers. 

Statistical analysis reveals $5-10 million budgets as the sweet spot of successful film investment. They allow for first-rate, Academy Award–winning production values without precluding superior risk-adjusted ROIs. Win-wins (i.e., outcomes benefiting filmmakers and financiers alike, rather than one group alone or one group at the expense of the other) become not only possible but increasingly likely. 

## Boldly go where others fear to tread 

The venerable Wall Street Journal has written about our success on its blog and in the newspaper's business section. So have other major publications (e.g., San Jose Mercury News, San Francisco Chronicle).                          

Film Angels regularly features such luminaries as Apple founder Steve Wozniak, AOL CEO Barry Schuler, Movielink CEO Jim Ramo, California Film Commissioner Hilary Armstrong, San Francisco Film Commission Executive Director Stefanie Coyote, and '90s pop sensation Lance Bass, to name a few. Internet giant Google even made its luxurious headquarters, the famed Googleplex in Mountain View, available to us exclusively for an unprecedented pitch extravaganza headlined by legendary rock icon Carlos Santana and billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper. 

## Unrivaled platform for the best and brightest 

With up to 1,000 potential investors in attendance at a time, Film Angels meetings have served as a powerful platform for the in-person pitches of many famous actors and celebrated filmmakers. Past highlights include Lori Petty ("League of Their Own," "Point Break," "Tank Girl," "Poker House"), Sean Astin ("Lord of the Rings," "Goonies," "Rudy"), David Lynch ("Twin Peaks," "Dune," "Mulholland Dr."), Matt Smith ("Crown," "Doctor Who," "House of the Dragon," "Womb"), Adrian Grenier ("Entourage," "Devil Wears Prada"), Peter Krause ("Parenthood," "Six Feet Under," "Truman Show"), Danny Glover ("Lethal Weapon 1-4," "Saw," "Color Purple," "2012," "Shooter"), David Arquette ("Scream," "Cougar Town"), Kristin Davis ("Sex and the City"), Frank Darabont ("Shawshank Redemption," "Walking Dead," "Green Mile," "Mist," "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"), Ajay Naidu ("Office Space," "Pi," "Bad Santa"), Ron Fricke ("Star Wars III," "Samsara," "Baraka"), Barrie Osborne ("Matrix," "Lord of the Rings," "Great Gatsby"), Eugene Roddenberry Jr. ("Star Trek," "Earth: Final Conflict"), and Ralph Guggenheim ("Toy Story"). 

We uncompromisingly invite only accredited investors with an express interest in movies to attend these one-of-a-kind private events and to participate in thoroughly vetted investment opportunities. (Under the federal securities laws, a company that offers or sells its securities must register the securities with the SEC or find an exemption from the registration requirements. The federal securities laws provide companies with a number of exemptions. For some of the exemptions, such as Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, a company may sell its securities to what are known as accredited investors. The term accredited investor is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.) 

## Dreams come true for producers 

Our angels, managers, and liaisons meet producers with bankable projects/productions on a wide variety of occasions (e.g., at industry events) around the globe, such as the AFM (American Film Market), Sundance, and Cannes. Regardless of how, where, and when we connect, you will eventually be asked to complete our short application form. We figuratively named it the Elevator Pitch after a common sport among founders in Silicon Valley: regaling potential investors with impossibly compact yet maximally effective fundraising pitches in what little time it takes to ride a random elevator to uncertain heights or depths together. You might as well square it away now: pitch your production at https://pitch.filmangels.com (powered by our fintech partner Greenlit). 

## Capitalize on your unfair advantage 

Starting with the Elevator Pitch (at https://pitch.filmangels.com), its exacting compactness, and its emphasis on unfair advantage (i.e., your project's secret/special sauce), the Film Angels process may seem unfamiliar at first or perhaps unconventional vis-à-vis entrenched Hollywood practices. Some dub it disruptive, to invoke a shopworn buzzword. We call it the Silicon Valley way of funding independent film. Rest easy, we do not expect your pitch to be perfect by any standard, much less so from the get-go. Indeed, we encourage you to share, revise/update, and elaborate on project details incrementally at your discretion. 

Film Angels is committed to supporting you and your production every step of the way. We will do all in our purview and power to ensure that you and our members succeed together, true to the win-win maxim at the heart of Film Angels' philosophy. We love working with producers. And producers like our style, too, we have been told. We make producer dreams—of producing movies on your own terms—come true.
